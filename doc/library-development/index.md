# Library development 🏗️

## Setup

Install [prerequisites](#prerequisites)

run `melos bootstrap` to install all dependencies.

If you work on rust code (`packages/rust_verifier/rust_builder/rust`) run `flutter_rust_bridge_codegen generate --watch` to generate the rust dart glue code.

Run build runner: (e.g for generating mocks)\
`dart run build_runner build`

## Architecture

The repo is setup as a monorepo and packages are split to enable user choice of what to include.\
The main package is `ndk` which is the main entry point for the lib user. \
Other packages like `rust_verifier` or `amber` are optional and can be included if needed.

NDK uses Clean Architecture. Reasons for it being clear separation of concerns and therefore making it more accessible for future contributors.\
You can read more about it [here](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html).

For initialization we use `presentation_layer/init.dart` to assemble all dependencies, these are then exposed in `presentation_layer/ndk.dart` the main entry point for the lib user.

Global state is realized via a simple [GlobalState] object created by `ndk.dart`. \
The lib user is supposed to keep the [NDK] object in memory.

Other state objects are created on demand, for example [RequestState] for each request.
