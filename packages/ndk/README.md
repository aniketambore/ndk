NDK (Nostr Development Kit) is a Dart library that enhances the Nostr development experience.\
NDK supplies you with high-level usecases like lists or metadata while still allowing you to use low-level queries enhanced with inbox/outbox (gossip) by default.\
Our Target is to make it easy to build constrained Nostr clients, particularly for mobile devices.

# Getting started

## Prerequisites

- dart SDK

### Prerequisites `ndk_rust_verifier`

- android SDK (also for desktop builds)
- flutter SDK
- rust ( + toolchain for target)

Rust toolchain android:

```bash
rustup target add \
    aarch64-linux-android \
    armv7-linux-androideabi \
    x86_64-linux-android \
    i686-linux-android
```

Rust toolchain ios:

```bash
# 64 bit targets (real device & simulator):
rustup target add aarch64-apple-ios x86_64-apple-ios
# New simulator target for Xcode 12 and later
rustup target add aarch64-apple-ios-sim
# 32 bit targets (you probably don't need these):
rustup target add armv7-apple-ios i386-apple-ios
```

## Install

Ndk has a core package `ndk` and optional packages like `rust_verifier` and `amber`.

```bash
flutter pub add ndk
```

Optional:

```bash
flutter pub add ndk_rust_verifier
flutter pub add ndk_amber
```

## Import

```dart
import 'package:ndk/ndk.dart';
```

Optional:

```dart
import 'package:ndk_rust_verifier/ndk_rust_verifier.dart';
import 'package:ndk_amber/ndk_amber.dart';
```

## Usage

> **more [examples üîó](https://pub.dev/packages/ndk/example)**

```dart
import 'package:ndk/ndk.dart';
import 'package:ndk_rust_verifier/ndk_rust_verifier.dart';

// init
final ndk = Ndk(
  NdkConfig(
    eventVerifier: RustEventVerifier(),
    cache: MemCacheManager(),
  ),
);

// query
final response = ndk.requests.query(
  filters: [
    Filter(
      authors: ['hexPubkey']
      kinds: [`Nip01Event`.kTextNodeKind],
      limit: 10,
    ),
  ],
);

// result
await for (final event in response.stream) {
  print(event);
}
```

> We strongly recommend using `RustEventVerifier()` for client applications. It uses a separate thread for signature verification and is therefore more performant.

# Features / what does NDK do?

- return nostr data based on filters (any kind).
- automatically discover the best relays to satisfy the provided request (using gossip)
- specify desired coverage on each request (e.g. x relays per pubkey)
- publish nostr events to optimal relays or explicit relays
- cache responses to save network bandwidth
- stream directly from cache and network (if needed)
- query and subscription, e.g., get data once; subscribe to data.
- plugin cache interface, bring your own db or use included ones: `inMemory`
- plug in verifier interface, bring your own event verifier, or use included ones: `bip340, rust`
- plug in event signer interface, bring your own event signer, or use included ones: `bip340, amber`
- contact list support, you can convert nostr_event to contact_list
- nip51 list support, you can convert nostr_event to nip51_list
- nip05 caching
- nip-47 [Nostr wallet connect](https://github.com/relaystr/ndk/blob/master/packages/ndk/lib/domain_layer/usecases/nwc/README.md)
- nip-42 Authentication of clients to relays
- nip-57 Zaps

## not Included

- ready to use feeds, you have to build them on your own (üö´ not planned)
- create && manage keypairs. You have to provide them (üö´ not planned)
- file upload (üîú planned)
- threading, you can do this on your own if you move ndk or only the event_verifier into its own thread (üîú planned)
- support for request overrides (you have to close and reopen requests) (ü§î unsure)

## Performance

There are two main constrains that we aim for: battery/compute and network bandwidth.

**network**\
Inbox/Outbox (gossip) is our main pillar to help avoid unnecessary nostr requests. We try to leverage the cache as much as possible. \
Even splitting the users filters into smaller relay tailored filters if we know the relay has the information we need.

**compute**\
Right now the most compute intensive operation is verifying signatures. \
We use the cache to determine if we have already seen the event and only if it is unknown signature verification is done. \
To make the operation as optimized as possible we strongly recommend using `RustEventVerifier()` because it uses a separate thread for verification.

### Gossip/outbox model of relay discovery and connectivity

The simplest characterization of the gossip model is just this: _reading the posts of people you follow from the relays that they wrote them to._

# Library development üèóÔ∏è

## Setup

Install [prerequisites](#prerequisites)

run `melos bootstrap` to install all dependencies.

If you work on rust code (`packages/rust_verifier/rust_builder/rust`) run `flutter_rust_bridge_codegen generate --watch` to generate the rust dart glue code.

Run build runner: (e.g for generating mocks)\
`dart run build_runner build`

## Architecture

The repo is setup as a monorepo and packages are split to enable user choice of what to include.\
The main package is `ndk` which is the main entry point for the lib user. \
Other packages like `rust_verifier` or `amber` are optional and can be included if needed.

NDK uses Clean Architecture. Reasons for it being clear separation of concerns and therefore making it more accessible for future contributors.\
You can read more about it [here](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html).

For initialization we use `presentation_layer/init.dart` to assemble all dependencies, these are then exposed in `presentation_layer/ndk.dart` the main entry point for the lib user.

Global state is realized via a simple [GlobalState] object created by `ndk.dart`. \
The lib user is supposed to keep the [NDK] object in memory.

Other state objects are created on demand, for example [RequestState] for each request.

### Folder Structure of `ndk`

## Engines

NDK ships with two network Engines. An Engine is part of the code that resolves nostr requests over the network and handles the WebSocket connections.\
Its used to handle the inbox/outbox (gossip) model efficiently.

**Lists Engine:**\
Precalculates the best possible relays based on nip65 data. During calculation relay connectivity is taken into account. This works by connecting and checking the health status of a relay before its added to the ranking pool.\
This method gets close to the optimal connections given a certain pubkey coverage.

**Just in Time (JIT) Engine:**\
JIT Engine does the ranking on the fly only for the missing coverage/pubkey. Healthy relays are assumed during ranking and replaced later on if a relay fails to connect.\
To Avoid rarely used relays and spawning a bunch of unessecary connections, already connected relays get a boost, and a usefulness score is considered for the ranking.\
For more information [look here](./doc/jit_engine/README.md)

**Custom Engine**\
If you want to implement your own engine with custom behavior you need to touch the following things:

1. implement `NetworkEngine` interface
2. write your response stream to `networkController` in the `RequestState`
3. if you need global state you can register your own data type in `global_state.dart`
4. initialize your engine in `init.dart`

The current state solution is not ideal because it requires coordination between the engine authors and not enforceable by code. If you have ideas how to improve this system, please reach out.

> The network engine is only concerned about network requests! Caching and avoiding concurrency is handled by separate usecases. Take a look at `requests.dart` usecase to learn more.
